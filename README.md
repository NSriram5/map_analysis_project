The project I will be doing for this class will be to create a utility that will accept a two dimensional array representing a map of connected nodes. Each node will have a processing bandwidth, a backlog queue and each connection will have a length. The utility will then generate a packet for each node addressed to each other node and the packets will be transmitted so that the nodes can register the most expedient directions to send future packets. Nodes without connection will be flagged. A program will then test the utility based on random packet generation to create a report on the map's efficacy with transmitting packets and the most heavily burdened nodes. These packets and nodes can then be analogized to human organizational systems that represent workflow pathways in an organization.  The program will help an organization scrutinize their organizational structure (or changes to an organizational structure) in order to comprehend if it aligns with reporting and work flow priorities.

Future testing with this utility can simulate the speed at which any new node successfully learns about its surroundings, the impact that having a node disabled (sick/busy department member) causes, but will not be included in this project.
